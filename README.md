# Snake Game Project

**Overview**  
The Snake Game is a fun and engaging project developed in Python, utilizing the Turtle graphics module. This classic arcade-style game challenges players to control a snake as it navigates the screen, growing in length by consuming food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

**Project Objectives**  
Through this project, users can gain experience with:
- Real-time movement and collision detection
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Basic game loop structure and logic

**Features**  
- **Endless Gameplay**: Keep playing as long as you can avoid collisions.
- **Food Collection**: The snake grows longer each time it consumes food.
- **Score Tracking**: Track your progress with an on-screen score counter.

**Technical Highlights**  
- **Python**: Written in Python for easy learning and customization.
- **Turtle Graphics**: Uses the Turtle module for simple graphics and movement.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Organized with classes to manage game elements like the snake, food, and score.

**Skills Developed**  
- **Game Mechanics**: Learn foundational concepts like collision detection and scorekeeping.
- **Python Programming**: Practice Python syntax and logical structure.
- **Graphics & Animation**: Use Turtle to create animated game visuals.

**Getting Started**  
1. Install Python (Turtle is included in Pythonâ€™s standard library).
2. Clone the project repository.
3. Run the game and start playing!
